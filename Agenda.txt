Typescript - not so scary!

* What is it? Why is it useful? Why should we use it?

* Standard 99% of uses
    - primitive types 
        - boolean:
        - integer:
        - array:
        - String:
        - enums:

    - nullable types
    - function types

* React component
    - Simple props/state
    - Importing
        - "As *" 
        - Require
    
* "Any" types
    - When to use them (casting)
    - When not to use them

* Pitfalls
    - Untyped packages
    - Standard objects (i.e. Window) that can be changed
    - Incomplete types (and the "any" workaround)
