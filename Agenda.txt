Typescript - not so scary!

* What is it? Why is it useful? Why should we use it?

* Standard 99% of uses
    - primitive types 
        - boolean: boolean
        - integer: number
        - array: Type[]
        - String: string
        - enums: Enum
    - nullable types: let user: User?;
    - function types: (wantedInteger: number, wantedBoolean: boolean) => number

* React component
    - Simple props/state
    - Importing
        - "As *" 
        - Require
    
* "Any" types
    - When to use them (casting)
    - When not to use them

* Pitfalls
    - Untyped packages
    - Standard objects (i.e. Window) that can be changed
    - Incomplete types (and the "any" workaround)
